				<h3>Operation Blowhole</h3>
				<p>
					Hunting humpback whales will lead to their complete extinction in the near future. They are highly intelligent creatures. Operation blow hole aims to actively protect the whales in the natural habitat, the ocean.
				</p>
				<h3>Operation Shark-fin Soup</h3>
				<p>
					Sharks have been hunted in East Asian waters for their fins, which are used in preparing the shark fin soup delicacy. Sharks are an important part of their ecosystem, and our efforts to protect them are essential. Our main 						protective practice is to throw the nets and cages on the hunters themselves.
				</p>
				<h3>Operation Dolphins</h3>
				<p>
					Every year in Taiji, Japan hunters trap dolphins and pilot whales in a cove. In addition to the damage done to the ecosystem balance, when they are killed they release mercury into the water.
